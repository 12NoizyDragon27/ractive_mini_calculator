       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'
  -->
  <script id='template' type='text/ractive'>
    <p>Input one</p>
    <input type='number' id='one' value='{{one}}' />
    <p>Input two equals input one squared</p>
    <input type='number' id='two' value='{{two}}' />
    <p>Input three equals input one divided by input the divisor</p>
    <input type='number' id='three' value='{{three}}' />
    <p>The divisor</p>
    <input type='number' id='divisor' value='{{divisor}}' />
  </script>

       If you want the newest features (unstable!), use the 'edge' version instead:

       If you need IE8 support, change 'ractive' to 'ractive-legacy'.

       4. We've got an element in the DOM, we've created a template, and we've
       loaded the library - now it's time to build our Hello World app.
